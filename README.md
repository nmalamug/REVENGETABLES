## Summary
### Category
Animated Game

### TL;DR
Infectious vegetables have infiltrated the farm and it is your responsibility to protect the crops and the farm!

### Description
Your mission is to safeguard the barn located at the screen's bottom. To fend off the relentless vegetable monsters, tap and drag your character to strike them down. As the game progresses, these menacing creatures will grow both in quantity and speed. Keep an eye on the red hearts in the upper right corner, as they represent your total number of lives. Beware! A grey heart signifies the loss of a life after a monster reaches the barn. Once all lives are depleted, the game ends. Your character's unique special ability can be customized in the settings. As a Geraldo the Dasher, you can tap any point on the screen to make your character leap there, vanquishing any monster in his path. Alternatively, as Debbie the Exploder, you can tap a specific location to send the vegetable monsters scattering. After using these abilities, your character turns blue, indicating that the special attacks are inactive. Use them strategically! Modify the difficulty level in the settings to alter the monsters' speed and your number of lives. Harder difficulty means higher score bonuses! Embrace the challenge, have a blast, and defend your barn from the wicked vegetable invasion!
